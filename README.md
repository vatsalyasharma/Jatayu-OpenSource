# Jatayu-OpenSource
Jatayu is a compressible flow, finite volume, unstructured grid, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver developed during my PhD at the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad and has been under constant development since. This is the open source version of the code.

The purpose of Jatayu-OS is to showcase capabilities of my code, make it available for benchmarking, and to make a base Made in India CFD code available for researchers (especially in India) that they can use, deploy, and develop for various Computational Mechanics applications.

An open-source CFD code that rivals successful, mature, and established CFD codes like OpenFOAM, SU2, and COOLFluiD is missing from the Indian Computational Mechanics landscape. The code aims to make CFD accessible to everyone.

Source code with documentation coming soon.

The open-source code is licensed under GPL3, and therefore cannot be used for commercial applications. However, please cite the original paper about Jatayu.
Version 1: Release date X/Y/2026. 
Capabilities: 

I have not open-sourced multiphysics capabilities of Jatayu. You are free to build your own multiphysics capabilities. The closed-source Jatayu can do supersonic turbulent flows, incompressible flows, and multiphase flows. Please write to me at comingsoon@emailid to obtain these versions or collaborate with me.
