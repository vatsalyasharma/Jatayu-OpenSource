# Jatayu-OpenSource
Jatayu is a compressible flow, finite volume, CFD solver developed during my PhD at the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad and has been under constant development since. This is the open source version of the code.
Coming soon.

The open-source code is licensed under GPL3, and therefore cannot be used for commercial applications. However, please cite original paper about Jatayu.
